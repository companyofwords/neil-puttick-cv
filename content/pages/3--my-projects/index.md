I am just starting on a process. For years, I was working as a maintainer, keeping old legacy websites going or using generic templates. From 2018, I am hoping to design better from the beginning with a full consideration of the whole lifecycle of a project.

Here are some of the previous websites that I have designed. (As soon as I can I will design a Gatsby page with React components to properly showcase them...)
