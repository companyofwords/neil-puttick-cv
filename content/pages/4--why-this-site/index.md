#Some good reasons...please

   * Something must be done to make better client sites that are super-fast, futureproof & easy to use and access for both developers and contributors. As someone who has spent years working on & fixing legacy CMS websites, I don't want to do it any more. Why can't we start off with simplicity and well-planned approaches, not bloated websites with unecessary baggage? 

   * We should work to reduce maintenance time not just development time. We need to appreciate how we cut down maintenance time, not just development: while Wordpress installations can be quick to setup, what is missed is often the fact that monitoring and managing them takes lots of resources, which should be avoided. At the [Festival of Maintenance](https://ti.to/festival-of-maintenance/2018-festival-of-maintenance/en) last week, I heard a number of speakers across many disciplines talk about how we shift the focus on decision-making and planning onto the whole lifecycle of an object, not just the "innovatory" moments. I think that changing this outlook is crucial for developing a sustainable web.

   * This site is a chance for me to start remoulding the things I learnt about Client Website & CMS into something that a client really wants. I believe in using the right tool for the job, not just the latest fad, but equally the amount of time, energy and research that has gone into speeding up and modernising the traditional CMS Website means that we must be on the look out for the technologies that let us move towards the future.


#Why I chose this site as the starting place:

* I have been looking for the cleanest and simplest GatsbyJS & React Starters to begin to develop a boilerplates or starter kit with admin. The site is built from one of the best starters for Gatsby that I found - [Gatsby Starter Personal Blog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog). With my background in designing Custom Wordpress Themes using Laravel Templating like [Roots Sage](https://roots.io/sage/), using this is a dream as much of the loading of pages, menus, collections of images is automatic. I am completely agnostic in my selection of which technology to use - just as willing to use Google Drive or Wordpress as the background (although to get a sense of speed and performance I am using the Wordpress REST API for specific projects where there is a lot of content to transfer over).  

    * The starter I used was immediately accessibility friendly & PWA ready - I am always looking to improve technical excellence & competence, but you have to prioritise simplicity for the user. I am receiving a lot of interest from people who would like similar sites.

    * I want to stay true to the principle of continual & iterative development, and this is a nice contained site which I can understand and then start to refactor, while continuing to lear React.

    * GatsbyJS can very quickly attach services and plugins which enable SEO, Analysis & USer Sharing & Comments without the weight. Having been used to [Yoast](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) and other Wordpress plugins, some of which have become compromised or bloated, I want the exceptional services without the weight.

    * You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Researching which technologies to use can and should involve "skinning" a website. I really enjoy approaching designer or architects I know and asking them for their thoughts with what to do. In this case, I need a CMS React or GatsbyJS Static site to show them as a starting point. 

    * This is my CMS Static playground - I can pull in React components from other projects. I can quickly add interesting things to specific parts of a website. I can learn and practice putting a variety of things onto this site.

    * This is my diary - Working without a team currently, I need a daily update in order to reflect and stay at same focus as a scrum team.

 It is wonderful it is to break out of the constraints of the Blog or CMS format of Wordpress and to be able to plan for websites without thinking about how we work round the [Wordpress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/wp-hierarchy.png). I know that Umbraco CMS similarly lets you break out of the blog templating. Contentful goes even further removing the term CMS all together.

This website is the opportunity for me to put what I am learning into a practical blog. From here, I will keep investigating the possibilities, especially how GraphQl can change my systems...

#Things to refactor on this website/ Changelog

* Animated Favicons
* Extended Netlify CMS so that users can add pages, as well
* Black mist floating across the screen from another project I am working on.
* Improve the Change Font Size across whole site
* Readability Filters - colours - choose from colour palette to overlay
