##Why I set this site up

* Something must be done to make better client sites that are super-fast, futureproof & easy to use and access for both developers and contributors. As someone who has spent years working on & fixing legacy CMS websites, I don't want to do it any more. Why can't we start off with simplicity and well-planned approaches, not bloated websites with unecessary baggage? 

* I have been looking for the cleanest and simplest GatsbyJS / React Starters to begin to develop a boilerplate / starter kit with admin. The site is built from one of the best starters for Gatsby that I found - [Gatsby Starter Personal Blog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog). With my background in designing Custom Wordpress Themes using Laravel Templating like [Roots Sage](https://roots.io/sage/), using this is a dream as much of the loading of pages, menus, collections of images is automatic. I am completely agnostic my selection of which technology to use - just as willing to use Google Drive or Wordpress as the background (although to get a sense of speed and performance I am using the Wordpress REST API for specific projects where there is a lot of content to transfer over).  

* We should work to reduce Maintenance time not just development time - Appreciating how we cut down maintenance time, not just development: while Wordpress installations can be quick to setup, what is missed is often the fact that monitoring and managing them takes lots of resources, which should be avoided. At the [Festival of Maintenance](https://ti.to/festival-of-maintenance/2018-festival-of-maintenance/en) last week, I heard a number of speakers across many disciplines talk about how we shift the focus on decision-making and planning onto the whole lifecycle of an object, not just the "innovatory" moments. I think that changing this outlook is crucial for developing a sustainable web.

* This site is a chance for me to start remoulding the things I learnt about Client Website & CMS into something that a client really wants. I believe in using the right tool for the job, not just the latest fad, but equally the amount of time, energy and research that has gone into speeding up and modernising the traditional CMS Website means that we must be on the look out for the technologies that let us move towards the future.










React & latest generations JS allow for us to only use the things we need in certain parts of the website, so I can add layers 



* I want to stay true to the principle of continuous development

* Not reinventing the wheel - Alan at our MAcclesfield Tech Group calls it skinning a website . I really enjoy approaching designer or architects I know and asking them for their thoughts with what to do. In this case 

* This is my playground - I can pull in my component library.

* This is my diary - As a solo operator, I need a diary, in order to reflect - As no-one really reads blogs anyway, this is more of an exercise for me than anyone else....(what I will say though is how wonderful it is to break out of the Blog / CMS  Format of Wordpress and to be able to plan for websites without thinking about how we work round the Wordpress Taxonomy - I know that Umbraco CMS similarly want to break out of the blog, Contentful go even further removing the term CMS all together)

Once I go-live

continual development - 

able to change requirement

always looking to improve technical excellence & competence 

look for simplicity

This website is the opportunity for me to put what I am learning into a practical blog.





From here, I will keep investigating how GraphQl can work, especially with Apollo & Redux 

##Technology Used

* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) 

* [ReactJS]() - Gatsby is built on React

* [##Netlify / Github Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/) - Netlify's allows continuous integration and development to happen straight from github version control. What is brilliant about too, is the possibility to separate CMS for Writers and Editors so that the client has an easy-to-use simple dashboard, using [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). When working with a bigger organisation (with more custom fields, content & contributors), such as [IDST!](https://idst.org), I am looking at using the [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) Service, which also has the benefit of taken the weight of a CMS off the website and works through an API.
