I am currently focused on developing lightning-fast websites to sell to clients. This process includes:

 * building a repository of reusable components & patterns for React and establishing a React “Kit” to speed up production for quicker workflow.
 * using GraphQL on top of REST API in development.
 * moving Wordpress sites to use Headless React Front-end to increase performance and security. Investigating how we can keep editor and client-friendly static CMS interface to get control over experience without code-bloating or hackability. 
 * managing content off-site as a service such as Contentful or even connecting Google Drive or Dropbox (for maximum user comfort).
 * looking at how users see the content they want quicker.
 * ensuring analytics can start feeding directly into site development, using UX tools like hotjar to analyse how users work on a website, and feed this back into continual development.
 * investigating vanilla JS, Web APIs and DOM manipulation tools without libraries.

By simplifying the technology in a project, I am looking to focus on the ideas & aesthetics best-suited for a client or project and that understand the problem.  

I am always looking to work more concisely and to learn and evolve my problem-solving skills. I avoid giving users unnecessary features, and use the technology that fits. My experience of working in SMEs means I can see the potential for projects to match the vision of a company or organisation and to inspire not just digital change but organisational change.


#Technologies Deployed

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) 

* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - Producing work like this website is the opportunity for me to put what I am learning into a practical blog. From here, I will keep investigating how GraphQl can work, especially with Apollo & Redux 

* [Netlify / Github Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/) - Netlify's allows continuous integration and development to happen straight from github version control. What is brilliant about too, is the possibility to separate CMS for Writers and Editors so that the client has an easy-to-use simple dashboard, using [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). When working with a bigger organisation (with more custom fields, content & contributors), such as [IDST!](https://idst.org), I am looking at using the [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) Service, which also has the benefit of taken the weight of a CMS off the website and works through an API.

* [Wordpress Rest-API](http://v2.wp-api.org/) 

* [Roots IO](https://roots.io/) - Using [Laravel Blades](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/blade) to clean up the Wordpress Template Hierarchy.

* [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)


#Tools

* [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf)

* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)

* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

* I am a reseller for [Kualo](https://www.kualo.co.uk/) which uses a CPanel Hosting service, which includes Cloudflare, SSL, Server-side Caching & Private GIT Repositories.
