I have started to build a list of interesting repositories, libraries and links to research areas that I am interested in....

* __Using GraphQL in API development__ to be able to use the data I need.

   * [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

   * [ApolloGraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/)


* __How Progressive Web Apps can enable quicker loading & offline experiences__ - particularly in rural or low-internet zones. 

    * [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/)


* __Pushing the boundaries of JS Development with ExpoJS with Native and Three JS__ -  using mobile technologies & augmented reality for business opportunities.


* __How web technologies can be more accessible and improve peopleâ€™s lives__ what reusable components can help to build a better web experience (including consideration of the neuro-diversity of users).


* __Incorporating Design Thinking into process more__ using prototypes more actively to solve the problems & the challenges. 

	* using React-Sketchapp to join design and development to let designers mock-up with real data,improve the design process:
	 
	* [React Sketch App](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp) - render to React from Sketch

	* Using JSON data in your designs in Sketch - [explanation](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/using-json-data-in-your-designs-in-sketch-a939bd4bd2c3)

	* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)


* __Learning testing structures__ Designing code with more pure functions & testability. Writing smaller code.

	* [UAT](https://usersnap.com/blog/types-user-acceptance-tests-frameworks/)


* __Improving graphics and animations__ Linking SVG graphics to functionality as part of a website.

    * [Nivo D3js & ReactJs](http://nivo.rocks/) - [explanation](https://medium.com/@gmonne/create-a-brush-component-using-nivo-dataviz-library-68074f3721ba)


* __Serving up Intelligent & Custom Content__ Working to show the user what they want to see, but making sure the user has the full picture.
