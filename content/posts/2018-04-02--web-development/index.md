* __I have 3 years vocational hands-on experience__ creating cutting-edge digital presence for SMEs & individuals in Bioscience, producing responsive web-apps and sites for projects and promotional campaigns.

* __I have worked independently and in small teams, but always for the client__ In my previous permanent role, I was responsible for building, maintaining & fixing legacy Wordpress & PHP & building custom themes & plugins for Wordpress that use Laravel or React for functionality. Mainly using [Roots](https://roots.io/) to offer full-spec, highly performant Wordpress, but also creating Member's Areas, Intranets, CRUD, quotation systems to extend what Wordpress could do.

* More recently, __I have started to use my love Full Stack JS, particularly React__ to make and manage dynamic, secure, rich-content, light-weight web-apps; offering customers the chance to migrate older websites to use some future-facing technologies, using FAN (Firebase) Stack and JAM Stack (Javascript, APIs, Markup) to improve the client & contributor experience. In converting legacy Wordpress sites, I am looking to let users continue to have the usability & accessibility they expect from the great plugins and services they have been used to.

* __I am investigating how to take CMS further__ to improve performance, security & user-experience, using Gatsby.JS, Netlify-CMS & Contentful investigating Serverless JAM (API & Saas) Stack. I am also investigating how we improve user experience in Wordpress, but I am also looking at how .NET Frameworks, like Umbraco can work alongside this. I have monved to technologies that will enable a holistic approach - seamlessly linking analytics to design so that you can showing the user what they want to see first.

* __I use strict testing and debugging__ and have set about creating DRY efficiency in my workflow. I also have an arsenal of tools to code quicker and make more: 
    * I use Visual Code Studio & Sublime with extensions & shortcuts, like Emmet.
    * I build cleaner code using ES6 & 7 with Babel compiler, removing HTML clutter & focusing on semantic markup to improve accessibility. 
    * I aim to make cleaner design: using JSS, SASS preprocessor & adopting newer CSS conventions like Grid Layout or Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to remove unnecessary time-consuming code and optimise sites.

* __I have a strong methodical workflow__ quickly and reliably scaffolding beautiful future-proof work using NodeJS to generate and manage sites: with NPM, Yarn, and Gulp. I make sure my work is fully documented and versioned with GIT version control from the command line.

![Part of a Team](./art-space.jpg)

* __I relish a challenge....__ and see many opportunities to make great things with web technologies.

* __I love working with others to make a product or service. I would like to work as part of an agile team__ or work within an agency, with project management structures & objectives.  In my previous role, I worked with a designer & SEO specialist, so know how to work with a team, but I would like to work within a system of continuous deployment & iterative approach to get best practice for UI & UX. I have used OOP or functional programmatic design to plan & rationalise.

 * __I see my job to enable others__ - I ensure client and team have access and the flexibility to work. I have experience making dashboards, social-media connected sites anyone can use, with accessibility integrated into the design. 
 
* __I am easy to contact__. I know how to liaise with, advise and teach stakeholders. 

* __I can explain what I am doing__ I can explain work to clients in a straightforward way, and use resources with plenty of communities, plugins and support.

* __I am pragmatic__: I am driven to find the correct fit and always willing to research and learn the best solution for the job (with Stack Overflow, Youtube, or online tutorials). From using SMS on a website for outdoor users to using PHP & legacy frameworks for reliability, I look to combine ease of use with the best technologies available.

* __I am an active part of communities__ As someone who is always learning.
