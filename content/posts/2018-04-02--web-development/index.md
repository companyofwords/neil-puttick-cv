* 3 years vocational hands-on experience creating cutting-edge digital presence for SMEs & individuals in Bioscience, producing responsive web-apps and sites for projects and promotional campaigns.

* Managing dynamic, secure, rich-content web-apps with love of React & JS using FAN (Firebase) Stack.

* Working independently for SMEs building, maintaining & fixing legacy Wordpress & PHP & building custom themes & plugins for Wordpress that use Laravel or React. 

* Now looking at how to take CMS further to improve performance & user-experience, using Gatsby.JS, Netlify-CMS & Contentful investigating Serverless JAM (API & Saas) Stack, but also open to .NET Frameworks. 

* Would like to work as part of an agile team or with project management structures. I am familiar with Front End Design-led for UX as well as OOP or functional programmatic design patterns. I love working with others to make a product or service.

* Strong methodical workflow quickly and reliably scaffolding beautiful future-proof work using NodeJS to generate and manage sites: with NPM, Yarn, and Gulp. GIT revision control from the command line.

* Using stricter testing and debugging, and DRY efficiency with arsenal of tools to code quicker and make more: Sublime & Visual Code Studio with shortcuts like Emmet. Cleaner code: using ES6 & 7 with Babel, removing HTML clutter & focusing on semantic markup to improve accessibility. Cleaner design: using SASS & innovative use of CSS like Grid Layout or AMP to remove unnecessary code like clearfix.

* Enabling - I ensure client and team have access and input choices to work. Making lightweight, social-media connected sites anyone can use, integrated into accessible CMS (like Wordpress with Roots or custom Underscores). Now looking at how to use headless front-ends, with CMS removed from the site to increase performance and security.
 
* I am contactable. I know how to liaise with, advise and teach stakeholders. - I can explain work to clients in a straightforward way and use resources with plenty of communities, plugins and support.

* Pragmatic: I am driven to find the correct fit and always willing to research and learn the best solution (with Stack Overflow, Youtube, or online tutorials), from using SMS on a website for outdoors to using PHP frameworks for reliability. Am looking to combine ease of use with the best technologies.
