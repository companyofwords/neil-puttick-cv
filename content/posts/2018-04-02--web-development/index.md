* __I have 3 years vocational hands-on experience__ creating cutting-edge digital presence for SMEs & individuals in Bioscience, producing responsive web-apps and sites for projects and promotional campaigns.

* __I have been working independently for SMEs__ building, maintaining & fixing legacy Wordpress & PHP & building custom themes & plugins for Wordpress that use Laravel or React for functionality. Mainly using [Roots](https://roots.io/) to offer full-spec, highly performant Wordpress, and offering to create Member's Areas, Intranets, CRUD, quotation systems to extend what Wordpress could do.

* More recently, __I am have started using my love of JS & React to make__ & manage dynamic, secure, rich-content web-apps and offering clients chance to migrating older websites to use future technologies, that create light-weight, using FAN (Firebase) Stack and JAM Stack- Javascript, APIs, Markup to improve client & contributor experience

* __I am investigating how to take CMS further__ to improve performance & user-experience, using Gatsby.JS, Netlify-CMS & Contentful investigating Serverless JAM (API & Saas) Stack, but also open to .NET Frameworks. 

* __I Would like to work as part of an agile team__ or with project management structures. I am familiar with Front End Design-led for UX as well as OOP or functional programmatic design patterns. I love working with others to make a product or service.

* __I have a strong methodical workflow__ quickly and reliably scaffolding beautiful future-proof work using NodeJS to generate and manage sites: with NPM, Yarn, and Gulp. Fully documented with GIT revision control from the command line.

* __I use strict testing and debugging__ and DRY efficiency with arsenal of tools in order to make the most out of technologies, to code quicker and make more: 
    ⋅⋅⋅I use Sublime & Visual Code Studio with shortcuts like Emmet.
    ⋅⋅⋅I build cleaner code using ES6 & 7 with Babel, removing HTML clutter & focusing on semantic markup to improve accessibility. 
    ⋅⋅⋅I aim to make cleaner design: using JSS, SASS & innovative use of CSS like Grid Layout or AMP to remove unnecessary time-consuming code.

* __I see my job to enable others__ - I ensure client and team have access and input choices to work. Making lightweight, social-media connected sites anyone can use, integrated into accessible CMS (like Wordpress with Roots or custom Underscores). Now looking at how to use headless front-ends, with CMS removed from the site to increase performance and security.
 
* __I am easy to contact__. I know how to liaise with, advise and teach stakeholders. - I can explain work to clients in a straightforward way and use resources with plenty of communities, plugins and support.

* __I am pragmatic__: I am driven to find the correct fit and always willing to research and learn the best solution (with Stack Overflow, Youtube, or online tutorials), from using SMS on a website for outdoors to using PHP frameworks for reliability. Am looking to combine ease of use with the best technologies.
