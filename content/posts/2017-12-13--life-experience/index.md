__I have worked across a broad range of industries & roles in the real world__

I believe in creating web development for a reason, and my experiences help me to create useful, practical tools and informative sites...My insight and skills have helped me listen to and understand the ideas of clients from different industries. 

I see it as vital to be a part of the communities we live in: virtual or real:

 * __I am a Town Councillor & have been chosen to stand for Parliament for Macclesfield Constituency__. I am now advising the [Town Council](https://macclesfield-tc.gov.uk) & [Labour Party](https://macclesfieldlabour.uk) on the tools they should use, and I am part of the community Coders For Labour. I have also advised on the needs of the UK web & IT industries and communities. 

 *__I use my hobbies & interests to help community work - I setup the group [IDST!](comedyofarrows.idst.org) to make community artworks with a range of transdisciplinary artists and makers. We currently run a tech & art groups at Macclesfield Community Artspace, and are now organising events and competitions. I am helping to setup a CIC (Community Interest Company) so that people's work pays off.

 * __I have lived, worked and travelled around the world__ 

 * __I enjoy staying fit and healthy__ I practice Yoga for web professionals daily... 

 * __I am good at knowledge sharing__: I worked previously as a learning mentor in the education system for 7 years, hosting & teaching European professionals to develop Business English for conversation, presentations, journalistic practice and marketing English. 

__A Realworld Creative with award-winning projects__ 

 * I have made live outdoors games and organising events for hundreds of people, and produced digital artworks for creative industries that take gamification back into the real world. I trained 100 actors to create an immersive Prison escape game, made a motorway "disappear", warped time in Cheshire and filled a space with 30,000 My Little Ponies. 

 * I co-founded Interval, an artist-led initiative in Bristol and have run microfunding events in Macclesfield. 

 * I have organised successful workshops, plays, and performances across Europe. Most recently, I was invited to run a Life-Swapping Initiative at Art Athina in Athens called [N](n.idst.org)

 * I setup a project to give every person in Macclesfield a brick to paint - [The Brick Project](https://macclesfield.brickproject.co.uk) and setup a green initiative around the town for the 90 Trees for the Queen commemorations. 

 * -I stay up-to-date, using twitter @companyofwords and contribute to a variety of forums online.
