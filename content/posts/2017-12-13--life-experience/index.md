__I have lots of experience of working across a broad range of industries & roles in the real world__. I also see it as vital to be a part of the community I live in. I believe in creating web development for a reason, and my experiences help me to create useful, practical tools and informative sites...My insight and skills have helped me listen to and understand the ideas of clients from different industries. 

* __I am a Town Councillor & have been chosen to stand for Parliament for Macclesfield Constituency__. Rather than see it get in the way of my development work, I found that it has complimented it. I am now advising the [Town Council](https://macclesfield-tc.gov.uk) & [Labour Party](https://macclesfieldlabour.uk) on the tools they need, but also on the needs of the UK web industries and communities. 

 * __I have lived, worked and travelled around the world__ 

* __I enjoy staying fit and healthy__ - and practice Yoga for web professionals daily... 

* __I am good at knowledge sharing__: I worked previously as a learning mentor in the education system for 7 years, hosting & teaching European professionals to develop Business English for conversation, presentations, journalistic practice and marketing English.
